# Incubyte_assessment
Hi,
- I used python progamming language to code and jupyter notebook as a IDE. 
- I used pandas library to load and clean the delimited text file data.
- I used mysql workbench to create database.
- I used SQLALCHEMY a python sql toolkit to Establishment a Connection to the mysql database and /
  to create tables and to load the clean dataframe to the mysql database.
  
 This is all the brief introduction about the ways i took to complete the assessment.
 
 Thank you
